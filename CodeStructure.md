The p5.accessibility library is made of the following parts: 

## Interceptors 

Interceptors refer to the class that is called over the execution of each p5 function. The interceptors call the respective entities (through register) and take the required information that is displayed to the user.
- [Base interceptor](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/blob/master/src/baseInterceptor.js)
- [Text interceptor](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/tree/master/src/textInterceptor)
- [Sound interceptor](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/tree/master/src/soundInterceptor)
- [Grid interceptor](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/tree/master/src/gridInterceptor)

## [Entities](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/tree/master/src/entities)
Refers to a class that takes care of specific p5 functions
All of the entities are registered in a registry. This is done so that when a function is called, the program knows which entity needs to be used.
- Base entity (base class)
- Fill entity (takes care of fill function)
- Shape entity (takes care of all the 2d shape functions)

## [Registry](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/blob/master/src/registry.js)

This class contains a register of entities and their respective p5 functions

## [Data](https://github.com/processing/p5.accessibility/blob/master/src/_data.js)
The data is essentially a list of all functions, their parameters, and outputs. This file it generated by the p5.js library.
